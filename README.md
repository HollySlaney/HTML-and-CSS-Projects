# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
## Introduction
This repository contains small projects and sample websites I made for the HTML and CSS section of my Tech Academy course. In these projects I'm using HTML, CSS, BootStrap and JavaScript.
## Sample Websites
+ Space Station Site
+ Movie Theatre Site
+ Small Side Projects
### Space Station Site
This site is a single page website about a space traveling company. You can book your space travel on the site! It of course has the HTML skeleton of the webpage and also styled with CSS. It has a navbar, image containers and a form.
### Movie Theatre Site
This single page site is a movie theatre homepage containing movie, movie times and a little bit about the town it is based in. This page is styled with BootStrap 4 and contains a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.
### Small Side Projects
These small projects were used mainly for practice and understanding of everything including HTML, CSS, JavaScrip and BootStrap.
